# Half MITM = Fake BTS only
# Why it is possible ?
* Fake base station with open ciphering named A5/0, and the  network could be GSM(sms, call), and GPRS, EDGE

# Attack limitations and advantages : 
* local attack but could be targeting (to find local victim)
* victim could be reached on the real network (indeed call and sms)
* could be detectable with rooted phone and application like imsi-catcher detector, snoopsnitch because of open network
